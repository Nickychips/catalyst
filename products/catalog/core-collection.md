# ðŸ‘• Core Collection

> *Essential Pieces for Daily Transformation*

The Core Collection represents the foundational elements of Catalyst apparelâ€”timeless pieces designed to serve as daily reminders of your power to create change.

## Collection Philosophy

### Minimalism with Meaning
Each piece in the Core Collection is stripped to its essence, featuring clean lines, quality materials, and symbolic design elements that provoke thought rather than distract from it.

### Mirror Integration
All pieces incorporate the signature reversed text element, designed to be legible when you look in the mirrorâ€”a daily reminder that transformation starts with you.

### Versatile Consciousness
Designed to move seamlessly from meditation to meetings, from coffee shops to boardrooms, carrying the message of transformation into every environment.
