# ðŸ”„ The Get/Give Model

> *Generosity as a Business Strategy*

## Philosophy

The Get/Give model isn't just a marketing tacticâ€”it's a manifestation of our core belief that transformation thrives in community and that generosity multiplies consciousness.

### Core Principle
**Every act of receiving includes the opportunity to give.**

When someone purchases a Catalyst piece, they receive two items: one for themselves (Get) and one to share with someone else (Give). This creates an unbroken chain of connection, generosity, and potential transformation.

## How It Works

### The Purchase
1. **Customer selects** their desired Catalyst piece
2. **System automatically includes** a second identical item
3. **Customer pays** for both pieces (built into pricing)
4. **Package arrives** with both items and giving instructions

### The Gift
1. **Customer decides** how to share the second piece
   - Give to someone they know who needs the message
   - Leave anonymously for a stranger to find
   - Share with someone they've just met
   - Hold onto it until the right moment/person appears

2. **Gift includes** a simple message:
   - "This found its way to you for a reason"
   - Brief explanation of Catalyst philosophy
   - Invitation to continue the chain if it resonates
   - No pressure, just possibility

### The Chain Reaction
1. **Recipient experiences** the unexpected gift
2. **May feel** called to learn more about Catalyst
3. **Might choose** to purchase and continue the cycle
4. **Creates** exponential community growth through generosity

## Business Model Integration
