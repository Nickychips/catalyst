# ðŸ“¹ Pages from Becoming: Episode Guide

> *An Imperfect Book Unfolding in Real Time*

"Pages from Becoming" is our flagship video series that documents the raw, unfiltered journey of building Catalyst while exploring themes of consciousness, transformation, and authentic living.

## Series Philosophy

### Vulnerability as Strength
We share the messy, imperfect process of creationâ€”the failures, breakthroughs, and everything in between. This isn't about presenting a polished image; it's about authentic documentation of transformation.

### Living Documentation
Each episode is a "page" in our ongoing story. The series evolves as we evolve, creating a real-time case study of conscious business building and personal growth.

### Community Invitation
Every episode invites viewers to reflect on their own journey and share their insights. This isn't passive consumptionâ€”it's active participation in collective transformation.
